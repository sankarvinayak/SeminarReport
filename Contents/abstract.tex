An associative memory system is a type of artificial neural network that can
learn and store associations between input and output patterns. Spiking neural
networks, on the other hand, are a type of neural network that models the
behaviour of neurons in the brain by using discrete time steps to simulate the
firing of individual neurons. Combining these two concepts can result in an
effective memory representation technique in which the contents can be accessed
with speed and efficiency. The report provides an overview of the principles of
associative memory and spiking neural networks, and then describes the
architecture and training procedure for the system. The results show that
spiking neural networks can be effective for implementing associative memory
systems, and have potential applications in a range of computational
neuroscience and machine learning problems.

% The aim of this seminar report is to explore the use of spiking neural networks
% for the construction of associative memory systems. An associative memory
% system is a type of artificial neural network that is able to learn and store
% associations between input and output patterns. Spiking neural networks, on the
% other hand, are a type of neural network that models the behavior of neurons in
% the brain by using discrete time steps to simulate the firing of individual
% neurons. In this report, we will discuss the principles behind both associative
% memory systems and spiking neural networks, and describe how they can be
% combined to create a powerful and efficient associative memory system. We will
% also present some experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of
% this approach. Overall, this report presents a promising new approach to the
% construction of associative memory systems, and shows the potential for further
% development and application in a variety of settings.
