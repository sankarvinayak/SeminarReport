Associative memory is a concept widely used in the cases in which the memory needs to be accesed based on the content.
A spiking neural network is a special type of neural network which simulates the biological neural network.
Combining these two concepts can result in an effective memory representation technique in which the contents can be accessed with speed and efficiency.
The report provides an overview  of the principles of associative memory and spiking neural networks, and then describe the architecture and training procedure for the system. 
The results show that spiking neural networks can be effective for implementing associative memory systems, and have potential applications in a range of computational neuroscience and machine learning problems.
