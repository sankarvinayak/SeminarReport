The ability to store and retrieve associations between different stimuli is a fundamental component of many cognitive processes, including perception, learning, and memory. Associative memory is a type of memory system that allows for the storage and retrieval of relationships between different items in memory. It is a key component of many artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, and has been extensively studied in both neuroscience and computer science.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a type of neural network that can simulate the dynamics of individual neurons and synapses in the brain. They have been shown to be effective for modeling a range of cognitive and sensory processing tasks, and have potential applications in a variety of fields, including computational neuroscience and machine learning.
\par
In this report, we present a study on the construction of an associative memory system using a spiking neural network. We describe the architecture and training procedure for our system, and evaluate its performance on a variety of associative memory tasks. We discuss the implications of our results for the use of SNNs in implementing associative memory systems, and highlight their potential applications in computational neuroscience and machine learning.
