\section{Associative Memory}

Also known as content addressable memory is a type of memory which is specially
optimized for access to memory locations without using the memory address of
the location that needs to be accessed.Associative memory of the electronic
circuit will have an extra connections which enables it to parallelly search
through the contents in a single clock pulse. It is widely used in application
like database management system which require searching through the data as fast as possible
figure \ref{associative_circuit} shows one such circuit

% Associative memory systems are a type of artificial intelligence technology
% that is used for storing and retrieving information based on patterns or
% associations. They are commonly used in applications such as pattern
% recognition, data storage, and information retrieval.

\section{Spiking neural network}
Spiking neural networks are a type of neural network that models the behaviour
of biological neurons by using spikes or pulses to encode and transmit
information. They are a relatively new type of neural network that has the
potential to improve the performance and efficiency of artificial intelligence
systems. The use of spiking neural networks for building associative memory
systems is a relatively new area of research that has only recently started to
gain attention.

% Associative memory systems: This would involve reviewing the existing research
% on different types of associative memory systems, such as Hopfield networks,
% boltzmann machines, and autoencoders. We would also review the key algorithms
% and techniques used for training and evaluating associative memory systems.

% Spiking neural networks: This would involve reviewing the existing research on
% spiking neural networks, including their principles, architectures, and
% applications. We would also review the key algorithms and techniques used for
% training and evaluating spiking neural networks.

% Combining associative memory and spiking neural networks: This would involve
% reviewing the existing research on approaches for combining the capabilities of
% associative memory systems and spiking neural networks. We would also review
% the key challenges and limitations of these approaches, and the current state
% of the art in this area.
