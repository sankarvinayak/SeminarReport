\chapter{Conclusion}%

This study presented a method for constructing an associative memory system
using a SNN. This approach combines the principles of associative memory and
SNNs to create a neural network architecture that can store and retrieve
associations between different stimuli.

There are active research going on to develop neoromorphic hardware which
improve the efficiency of different operation involved in processing of
information using an SNN. The hardware Lohi and software for that Lava are
developed by intel to this application. The software like \textbf NEST and
SpikeTorch are open source tools for the SNN. As more and more research is done
in this field, it could be the next generation machine learning algorithm.
