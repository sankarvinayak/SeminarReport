\chapter{Conclusion}%

% In conclusion, the study demonstrates the feasibility of using spiking neural
% networks for implementing associative memory systems. The SNN-based associative
% memory system is able to perform robust and efficient associative memory
% retrieval, and discuss the potential applications of this approach in
% computational neuroscience and machine learning. Our findings indicate that
% SNNs are a promising tool for modeling and implementing associative memory
% systems, and highlight the need for further research in this area.\par

This study presented a method for constructing an associative memory system
using a spiking neural network (SNN). This approach combines the principles of
associative memory and SNNs to create a neural network architecture that can
store and retrieve associations between different stimuli.

There are active research going on to develop neoromorphic hardware which
improve the efficiency of different operation involved in processing of
information using an SNN. The hardware \textbf{Lohi} and software for
that\textbf{Lava} are developed by intel to this application. The software like
\textbf{NEST} and \textbf{SpikeTorch} are open source tools for the SNN. As
more and more research is done in this field, it could be the next generation
machine learning algorithm.
% We evaluated the
% performance of our system on a range of associative memory tasks and
% demonstrated its ability to perform robust and efficient associative memory
% retrieval.

% The results indicate that SNNs can be effective for implementing associative
% memory systems, and have potential applications in a range of computational
% neuroscience and machine learning problems. In particular, the use of SNNs
% allows for the simulation of the dynamics of individual neurons and synapses,
% which may be important for modelling the neural basis of associative memory. In
% addition, the ability of SNNs to process and integrate sensory inputs in real
% time may be useful for implementing associative memory systems that can operate
% in real-world environments.
% \par
% There are several directions for future work in this area. One potential
% direction is to explore the use of different SNN architectures and learning
% algorithms for implementing associative memory systems. Another interesting
% direction is to investigate the use of SNNs for implementing more complex
% associative memory tasks, such as those involving temporal or spatial
% relationships. Additionally, it will be important to continue to develop and
% refine SNN-based associative memory systems through rigorous evaluation and
% testing.
% \par
% In conclusion, our study demonstrates the potential of SNNs for implementing
% associative memory systems, and highlights the need for further research in
% this area. We believe that the development of effective SNN-based associative
% memory systems has the potential to advance our understanding of both the
% neural basis of associative memory and the application of machine learning
% algorithms to cognitive tasks.
