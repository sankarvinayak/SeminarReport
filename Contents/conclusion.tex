\chapter{Conclusion}%

This paper provided a technique for building an SNN-based associative memory
system. Associative memory and SNNs are used in this method to produce a neural
network design that can store and recall information based on the associations between various stimuli.

There are active research going on to develop neuromorphic hardware which
improves the efficiency of different operation involved in the processing of
information using an SNN. The hardware Lohi\cite{lohi} and software for that
Lava\cite{lava} are developed by intel for this application. Software like
\textbf NEST\cite{nest} and SpikeTorch\cite{spiketorch} is open source tool for
the SNN. As more and more research is done in this field, it could be the
next-generation machine learning algorithm.
