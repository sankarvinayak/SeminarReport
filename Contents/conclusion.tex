\chapter{Conclusion}%

This study presented a method for constructing an associative memory system
using an SNN. This approach combines the principles of associative memory and
SNNs to create a neural network architecture that can store and retrieve
associations between different stimuli.

There are active research going on to develop neuromorphic hardware which
improves the efficiency of different operation involved in the processing of
information using an SNN. The hardware Lohi\cite{lohi} and software for that Lava\cite{lava} are
developed by intel for this application. Software like \textbf NEST\cite{nest} and
SpikeTorch\cite{spiketorch} is open source tool for the SNN. As more and more research is done
in this field, it could be the next-generation machine learning algorithm.
