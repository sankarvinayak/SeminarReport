\begin{description}
    \item[Hebb's learning rule:] When an axon of a cell A is sufficiently close to excite
        a cell B, and repeatedly and or persistently takes part in firing it some
        growth related process or metabolic changes takes place in one or both of the
        cell such that A's efficiency, as one of the cells firing B is increased.
